I'm just starting my career making cool stuff with computers, and I hope that as I have more time on this massive floating rock this page will fill up more and more with projects that I'm proud to share.\r\n\r\n### Rierastudioart.com\r\nThis is the first website I ever fully developed (so it took around 3x as long as it should have).  June 2016, I travelled to Havana, Cuba to work with a local artist, Samuel Riera and his assistant, Derbis Campos.  I worked with them everyday to design and code a website to showcase the work they promote to the world outside of Cuba.  I developed a custom php framework to handle including partials on every page, and also to generate all of the pages for the artists and exhibitions. I'm still working on making it mobile (I've learned my mobile-first lesson), but view it on a desktop by following this link: [Rierastudioart.com](http://www.rierastudioart.com)\r\n\r\n### Artsy Processing Scripts\r\nProcessing is, \r\n> \"a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.\" \r\n>[Processing.org](processing.org).  \r\n\r\nThere's a javascript library, p5.js, which I used to transfer some of my projects online so others can see and interact with them using GitHub pages.  \r\n* [Primitives](https://dankrajnak.github.io/primitives)\r\n* [Meta-Sphere](https://dankrajnak.github.io/meta-sphere)\r\n* [Meta-Sphere-With-Springs](https://dankrajnak.github.io/meta-sphere)\r\n\r\n### Twitter Bots\r\n...coming soon hopefully.\r\n\r\n### School Assignments\r\nI've made javascript calculators, multi-threaded buffered queues, recursive descent parsers, huge complicated database schemas, sorting algorithms in assembly, and many other things which for academic integrity reasons, I can't share online... Oh well...\r\n",
