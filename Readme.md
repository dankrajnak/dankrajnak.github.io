# DanielKrajnak.com Blog Generator

This blog is created with Hexo, a static blog generator.  You can view the site here: [danielkrajnak.com](https://danielkrajnak.com).

I made a custom theme, which isn't made to be used for any other site, although maybe in the future I'll make it a little more general.  At the moment, the index page is included in the theme and the index page in the source folder is just a stub.  Almost all of the content of the site, besides the markdown for the blog posts can be found in the `themes/custom` folder.
