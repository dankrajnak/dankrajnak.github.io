#### Interactivity
Move your mouse around to see the persepctive change

#### File Structure
All sources files are in `src`.  These files are compiled from es6 to the `build` folder.  The files are concatenated with the `vendor` file and minified into the `dist` folder.

#### TODO
Create a function which calculates the coordinates of the first point of the second square so that the cube is always an equal height and width.
