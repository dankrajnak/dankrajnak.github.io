If you have ever visited a sit-down restaurant, then you can understand the basics of Express. But if you are just starting to build your first Node.js back end…you might be in for a bumpy ride.

Yes — it is certainly easier to learn Node if you have past experience with JavaScript. But the challenges you will face while building a back end are completely different than the ones you face while using JavaScript on the front end. When I learned Node, I chose the hard way. I studied eBooks, written tutorials, and videos over and over until I finally understood why I was doing what I was doing. There is an easier way. I am going to use a restaurant analogy to explain four key parts of your first Express app. Express.js is a popular framework for organizing your code, and I would recommend it for any beginner. I’ll explain further in a moment.

In this example, you are the restaurant owner. And you need to hire an expert to run the day-to-day operations of your new restaurant. You certainly aren’t an expert, and you can’t leave it to the waitstaff and kitchen to figure out.
If you want to run an efficient and safe restaurant, you need someone to keep your staff working at maximum efficiency. Express is the new manager.

# Hey.  Welcome.

The first part is pretty straightforward. Like with any other NPM package, you need to npm install the express module and then use a require statement to load the module.
