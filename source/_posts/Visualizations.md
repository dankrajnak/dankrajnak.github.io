description: Some sketches of the different parts of the installation
---

I made some sketches of what the installation will probably look like.  Let's start with the phone:

I'll be using an older phone which will stand on a podium to be around counter height.  This phone will be placed in a secluded area, which depending on the space in Hopkins, could still look a few different ways.  Here, it's drawn as a small room with a curtain.  This will be figured out *hopefully* very soon.

The headphones will rest on a small bar connected to a wall.  Next to the headphones will be a black box sitting on a podium, in which the raspberry pi responsible for loading the messages will reside.  The box will be locked with a padlock, and the headphones will feed in through the top.  It will probably be necessary to have a hole in the back of the box to supply power to the raspberry pi.

I found a button on amazon which comes with a case and which has to be twisted before it's pushed.  I think this would be a cool way to help hinder people who aren't familiar with its function from pressing it.  This way, it's a little easier to assume that the button will only be pressed by someone who intended to erase all the messages.
