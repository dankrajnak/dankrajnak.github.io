<p>I am in my last few semesters studying computer science at the Ohio State University, but I'm just starting my career making cool stuff with computers.  As time goes on my hope is that this page will fill up more and more with projects that I'm proud to share.</p>

<p>In June 2016, I travelled to Havana, Cuba to work with a local artist, Samuel Riera and his assistant, Derbis Campos.  I worked with them everyday to design and code a website to showcase the work they promote to the world outside of Cuba. I developed a custom php framework to handle including partials on every page, and also to generate all of the pages for the artists and exhibitions.  This is the first website I ever fully developed, so I made some mistakes but learned a ton.  I'm still working on making it mobile (I've learned my mobile-first lesson), but view it on a desktop by following this link: <a href="http://www.rierastudioart.com">Rierastudioart.com</a></p>

<p>These are various art projects I've made since I was just beginning to learn how to code.  Especially with my earlier projects, I'm working on cleaning up the code so that they are more efficient and easier to read.  All projects were originally written using processing, but have been translated to javascript using the p5.js library.  I am hoping to learn d3.js, so come back soon to see some future data-driven projects.</p>

<a id="school-assignments" class="anchor" href="#school-assignments" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>School Assignments</h3>

<p>I've made javascript calculators, multi-threaded buffered queues, recursive descent parsers, huge complicated database schemas, sorting algorithms in assembly, and many other things which for academic integrity reasons, I can't share online.  Let me know if you would like to see some of my work.</p>
