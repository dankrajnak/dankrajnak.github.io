<p>I am in my last few semesters studying computer science at the Ohio State University.  I'm just starting my career making cool stuff with computers, and I hope that as I have more time on this massive floating rock this page will fill up more and more with projects that I'm proud to share.</p>

<p>This is the first website I ever fully developed (so it took around 3x as long as it should have).  June 2016, I travelled to Havana, Cuba to work with a local artist, Samuel Riera and his assistant, Derbis Campos.  I worked with them everyday to design and code a website to showcase the work they promote to the world outside of Cuba.  I developed a custom php framework to handle including partials on every page, and also to generate all of the pages for the artists and exhibitions. I'm still working on making it mobile-compliant (I've learned my mobile-first lesson), but view it on a desktop by following this link: <a href="http://www.rierastudioart.com">rierastudioart.com</a></p>

<p>Processing is a "flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts" (Processing.org](<a href="https://processing.org">https://processing.org</a>)).  There's a javascript library, p5.js, which I used to transfer some of my projects online so others can see and interact with them using GitHub pages.  </p>

<p>I've made javascript calculators, multi-threaded buffered queues, recursive descent parsers, huge complicated database schemas, sorting algorithms in assembly, and many other things which for academic integrity reasons, I can't share online... Oh well...</p>
